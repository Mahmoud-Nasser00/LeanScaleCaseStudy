# LeanScaleCaseStudy

first i apologize for the late delay i had very strong circumastances that couldn't let me deliver in the estimated time, and i know i had to send an email with the delay but i couldn't do this also due to this circumastances

Here App Demo Info:-

- Design Pattern:
  i decided to go on with Non massive MVC Pattern as it suitable for simple projects and faster in creation.

- Database Service:
  i decided to choose saving favorites in core data service over user defaults or realm as it's more convenient in this case
  
- the most thing i liked in this app is See More and See less in movie details description

- the most thing i need to improve is to add loading controller , showing rates of movies, sorting by rate or alphabitical, add more animation to views, sign in and sign up for user favourites and watched histories
- i choose to make movie details in UIViewController for future updated to be easily managed and reusable

- missing things:
  favorite button in movie details to be un clipped
  add loading controller when wloading api request data
